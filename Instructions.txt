Have a program like apache and mysql. Recommended to use XAMPP control panel.
    Download from here: https://www.apachefriends.org/

Pull each file from the repository

If not already, download XAMPP controll panel, run in administative mode and download Apache and mysql by clicking the red "X"

Import the phptest.sql into mysql by clicking: admin in XAMPP control panel, then import at the top of the screen, and select phptest.sql

Move all files into a folder in htdocs called php.
    To find folder look in C: folder for XAMPP, then look for htdocs, then create folder called php
    For me the file path looks like: C:\xampp\htdocs\php

access the folder where you save your files in a localhost. 
    An example based on my machine looks like localhost/php

All setup steps are done! Play around with the program.
